Horizontal Timeline
=========

An easy to customize, horizontal timeline powered by CSS and jQuery.

Adapted by Studocwho.

This version:
   - Set event dot intervals.
   - Prev/Next buttons are now the prev/next event.
   - New scroll left/right buttons allow scrolling the timeline (like the prev/next buttons did).
   - New inactive states of buttons.
   - Dynamically creating the event dots according to the total of events there are, setting information found from the event-content data attributes.
   - month only/year only or full date event dot captions.
